# AutoBlog-Engine üöÄ

An AI-powered, fully automated blogging pipeline leveraging n8n, Google Sheets, and Gemini for end-to-end content creation and social media distribution. This project turns a simple Google Sheet into a powerful content strategy and generation dashboard.



## ‚ú® Overview

Manually handling SEO research, writing articles, and crafting social media posts is time-consuming. **AutoBlog-Engine** automates the entire process. It starts with a cron job, performs in-depth SEO research, generates high-quality articles, creates corresponding social media posts, and then publishes them, all with minimal human intervention.

The entire workflow is orchestrated by **n8n**, with **Google Sheets** acting as the central "brain" and control panel, updated in real-time via webhooks and enhanced with **Google Apps Script**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Workflow)

1.  **Trigger:** An **n8n** cron job initiates the workflow on a set schedule.
2.  **Research:** n8n calls **DataForSEO** and **Gemini** APIs to gather SEO data, keywords, and audience insights for a given topic in a particular neeche.
3.  **Sheet Update:** The research data is sent to **Google Sheets** via a webhook.
4.  **Internal Processing:** A time-based **Google Apps Script** trigger runs, processing the new data, perhaps refining topics, preparing content briefs.
5.  **Content Generation:** Based on the cells filled, a status section updates automatically, the researched data is put into RightBlogger to develop the article, SEO optimization, etc. and the link is posted back in the sheet.
6.  **Social Media Creation:** The generated article text is sent to the **Gemini** API, which returns formatted posts for social media, images are generated seperately curated for each social media.
7.  **Distribution:** n8n takes the social posts and uploads them to respective social media accounts.
